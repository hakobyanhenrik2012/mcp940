    <h2>Cristiano Ronaldo</h2>

    <div class="content">
        <div class="text">
            <p>Cristiano Ronaldo grew up in a small tin-roofed home in Madeira, Portugal. Ronaldo's house was level with the ground. Many are convinced that this was his wish, because he did not want the public to find out in what kind of misery he lived.</p>

            <p>He developed a passion for football at a very young age. He loved the game so much that he would miss meals or escape out of his window with the ball.</p>

            <p>At 12, Ronaldo had to say goodbye to his family to play for Sporting Youth Club, located 600 miles from his home. It was the most difficult time in his sporting career. He cried every day because he missed his family. Everyone laughed at him due to his poor accent. He found it impossible to get used to the locals and big city life.</p>

            <p><span class="highlight">His quote:</span> "In difficult times, you learn a lot about yourself. You have to stay strong and focus on what you really want."</p>

            <p>At 15, he was diagnosed with "racing heart", a condition that might have forced him to give up football. But that did not stop him. Soon after the laser surgery, he was back at training again and trained even harder.</p>

            <p>His dazzling footwork and goal-scoring abilities caught the eye of Manchester United, who signed him for $20 million. It was in a friendly game between Sporting and Man. Utd (3:0). All players went to coach Alex Ferguson and told him that they must sign this youngster.</p>

            <p>No matter which team he was on, he conquered the playing field with his top-notch performance. He won everything with Manchester United and Real Madrid. He won the European Championship with the national team of Portugal.</p>

            <p>He does not drink, because his father was an alcoholic. He does not smoke, he does not have a tattoo, and he donates a lot of money to charities.</p>

            <p>Today, Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the best football players of all time. Respect!</p>
